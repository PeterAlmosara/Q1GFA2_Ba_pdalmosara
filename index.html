            step in the business development process. After you are satisfied that a reliable market exists, the availability of the market and the possible
             rivals you are likely to face in the market becomes the next big issue. This is done by analyzing who the direct and indirect competitors are.
            The direct competitors are those individuals selling similar products as yours. A deeper knowledge of what they offer, charge, what they do well,
             and what they are not and the existence of any gaps that you may use to woo customers on your side is very important. Indirect competitors are 
             those other business players who deal with complimentary products to the goods and services you want to offer.Realistic forecasts boosts ones 
             confidence and the ability to meet own commitments. When you set the required costs straight it means you wont require extra capital after the
              business has started and thus there are chances that the business may run successfully without shortages in the required running capital.
